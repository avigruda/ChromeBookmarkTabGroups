# ChromeBookmarkTabGroups
Bookmark and restore Chrome's tab groups

A Chrome extension which adds to the context menue in tabs the following:
* Save all tabs of the current group in the "Saved Groups" folder in the "bookmarks Bar"
* Restore the group in the tab (Chrome added this option too lately)
* Copy to the bookmarked folder's content (title and url) to the clipboard

Some additional points:
* The "Saved Groups" folder can be edited manually
* No duplicate group name support - url's from identical groups, will be added to the same bookmarke folder.
