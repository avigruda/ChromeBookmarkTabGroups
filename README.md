# ChromeBookmarkTabGroups
Bookmark and restore Chrome's tab groups

A Chrome extension which adds to the context menu of tabs the following:
* Save all tabs of the current group in the "Saved Groups" folder in the "Bookmarks bar"
* Restore a saved group
* Copy the bookmarked folder's content (title and url) to the clipboard

Some points:
* The "Saved Groups" folder can be edited manually (add/remove folders) with Chrome's UI
* No duplicate group name support, and the URL's from will be added to the same bookmark folder
* Existing URL's, aren't saved again in the bookmark folder
* Group colors aren't saved

The extension icon is taken from http://www.iconbeast.com

Chrome's webstore link for the extension is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-groups/gfaojaacbhaapmmcmgbblhaghhgdnccp
